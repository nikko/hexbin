These are Notes about things I did to Nicolas' version (of 2002-04),
primarily aimed at fellow BioCorers.
Hence this file is in ./.Rbuildignore and therefore won't be exposed in the
distro.

Working on ./hexbin.R
---------------------
 - several functions share ``cut&paste identical code''
   ==> fix this eventually {via private functions once we have namespaces}

 - add PACKAGE = "hexbin" to .Fortran() calls

 - Many places have  return("<error message").
   Changed most to stop("....") and a few to  warning("....")


CVS add new things:
------------------

\rm -f TITLE ; cvs delete TITLE ; cvs commit -m'deprecated' TITLE

cvs add Biocore-notes
cvs add .Rbuildignore

cvs add data
(cd data ; cvs add NHANES.rda)
(cd man; ; cvs add NHANES.Rd)
cvs commit -m'data set newly added' data/NHANES.rda man/NHANES.Rd

cvs add tests
(cd tests ; for f in *.R *.Rout.save ; do cvs add $f ; done)
cvs commit -m'tests -- originally from bin2d/tests' *.R *.Rout.save


-------

In tests/large.R , the main thing was calling hplot() on
    ans.25mil
which should probably be a large data set.
No idea where I could find that.
Ask Dan Carr ?

--------------------

Running tests/hdiffplot.R   gives warnings about "gamma setting"
There must be something ``wrong by design'' there

--------------------

Missing functionality originally in Dan Carr's code ?

  ../bin2d/man/hthin.Rd --> documents  hthin()

which currently is also mentioned in several man/*.Rd pages here.
but there's no S/R code for hthin() in ./R/ at all
nor any in ./src/

---

Should capitalize (and abbreviate!) the \title{}s some time ...

Done:
    o	no single precision anymore

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

S-plus has a version of the code from Dan Carr;
we try to use their naming scheme **apart** from the class/methods,
where we want S4 classes, not S3 ones :

 S-plus name	 bin2d orig.(D.Carr)	 Hexbin pkg name
 -----------	 ---------------	 -----
 hexbin		 hbin			 hexbin
 hexagons	 = hexagons		 hexagons
 hex.legend	 hlegend

    erode.hexbin herode
 identify.hexbin  __NA__
     plot.hexbin hplot
   smooth.hexbin hsm
  summary.hexbin  __NA__

      _NA_	 hboxplot
      _NA_	 hdiffplot


 Note that where Dan Carr's  "bin2d" had the5 hexagon styles with short
 names, S-plus has longer names __which we adopt as well__ :

 S-plus name	 bin2d (D.Carr)
 -----------	 --------------
 grayscale	   g
 centroids	   cm
 lattice	   lat
 nested.lattice	   nest
 nested.centroids  nestcm
