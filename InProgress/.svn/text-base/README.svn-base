Main ideas:

1) "port to grid" (partially done, not ok)
2) "move to S4 classes"
3) lattice like function

./hexplot.R	  : plot.hexbin() using grid
./grid.hexagons.R : grid.hexagons() replacing hexagons() using grid;

./Grid-hexplot.R  : idea of a gplot.hexbin()
		    ``such that plot can be resized AND hexagons keep shape''

		    --> i.e. "aspect ratio == fixed"
		        since hexagons correspond to original x-/y- scale
			and its hbinning.

./xy.hexplot.R	  : try lattice using "xyplot" alike

./hmatplot.R	  : make hmatplot() generic with a default and formula method
